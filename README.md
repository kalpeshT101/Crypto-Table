    You can use any CSS framework that you want but the app should be responsive.

    The data is constantly changing so make sure the user sees the current data by updating the data at a reasonable interval. Use React states to store the data.

    You can play around with the CSS as you like to make the page look elegant.

    Use pagination to show only 10 entries at a time.

    The Table rows should be sortable with Currency Name, Currency Price and Currency Rank

    Search Functionality:

        Any change in Search input should filter the table and show only the rows with Currency Name, Currency Symbol containing the character entered in the input box. (Eg: If the input is Bit, rows whose coin name/symbol includes “Bit” should show up)

    List item should contain:

        Currency Rank

        Currency Name (eg. Bitcoin)

        Currency Symbol (eg.  BTC)

        Currency Price (eg. $1050.24)

        Currency Price Change (eg. 1.23%)
